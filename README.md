# Anime-Rec-Form
This is just an anime recommendation form that doesn't actually save the recommendations, but will accept or deny based on user input by redirecting the user to a different page. 

This is just something I created to put onto my resume just to have something to show that I know how to build in HTML and CSS while also having something that I made to be a little fun.
